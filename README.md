Spectator's landing page for 2019 orientation

## Setup

Start: `npm start`

Storybook: `npm run storybook`

## Development Best Practices

* All react files have `.jsx` extention, this helps linters run smoothly
* Commit intelligently, whenever you create new functionality in your component (no stupid names please)
* Commit and push to your own branch (that describes the feature)

## Pre-commit

This project uses pre-commit hooks which run
* `eslint`
* `stylelint`
* `prettier`

Your commits will need to pass these checks to be pushed to the branch

## Merging

* As stated earlier you are only allowed to push to your own branch
    * Only Arsalaan and Billy can push to master
* Once you push submit a PR and assign either `ArsalaanAnsariDeveloper` or `WilliamChiu` to review it.
